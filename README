READ ME FIRST

you must create a personal directory for yourself
any unrelated file pushed into root dir will be deleted in one week

if you do a wrong commit, just delete it BY YOUR SELF.

A clear description for you changeset if need , if you commit a changeset just like "test" or "1234", it will be deleted.
And if any patch on codes, request a code review.

p.s. remember to clear your personal dir ,because we have only 4GB
